- Road has no alleviation

- Audio support? no

- Discrete model vs time continuous model? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_traffic_flow_model - am choosing discrete model
    - frames per second?
        - render rate:
            - 30 fps? too much burden to the computer
            - 5 fps? looks choppy
            - final decision: 10fps
    - How frequently run a simulation? every frame? every frame for now (if calculation became bottleneck, we can adjust)

- How soon can a car accelerate to 100km/s from 0 speed?
    - 10 seconds - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_to_60_mph

- How fast can a car brake
    - braking distance
        - usually 35m
        - https://www.amsi.org.au/teacher_modules/pdfs/Maths_delivers/Braking5.pdf
    - -10 m/s^2

- Should car always use the max accelerate / decelerate speed?
    - maybe involve randomness here
    - Intelligent Driver Model: https://imaginary.org/sites/default/files/trafficsimulation_documentation.pdf
    - use my own theory
        - accelerate: always use the max
        - decelerate: check distance
            - start to brake when there is less than 50 meters
            - brake the hardest when there is less than 25 meters

- what about a crash?
